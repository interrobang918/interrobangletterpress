		<blockquote> 
		<p>Printing with lead type is a painstaking, highly specialized and ancient
		   craft. Indeed it is a 550 year tradition in western culture whose
		  antecedents 
		  travel even further back to Asia. I attempt, while keeping the skills
		   and equipment of letterpress alive, to produce printed work of unequaled
		  
		  craft and beauty. The skills of mind, hand and eye combine to create
		   unique custom printed ephemera ranging from fine wedding invitations
		   to baby announcements, music packaging &amp; posters to linen-thread 
		  stitch-bound chapbooks. Any job requiring eclectic or classic typographic
		   treatment and first-class presswork would be a candidate for design 
		  &amp; printing at interrobang. </p>
		<p>My aim is to offer up the services of a small town "job printer" with 
		  the informed style of an urban artist craftsman. A post modern stationer's
		   shop as it were. Small run, hand produced booklets, stationery, keepsakes 
		  &amp; ephemera with more cach&eacute; than Crane's (i.e. not pushed across
		  a table in a 3-ring  sample binder) and at a more reasonable price
		  point. To mix metaphors with the fine tradition of hand-tailoring,
		  all work is bespoke in the
		  finest meaning 
		  of the term, with consultation and &quot;fitting&quot;, production, and 
		  delivery of printing that fits you alone.</p>
		  <p>Metal foundry type is the material I most love to manipulate in order
		    	to design and produce my work. The realities of increasingly rare
		     types and the ultimate convenience of the computer mean that interrobang
		    
			harnesses the most powerful illustration and layout applications
		    to,  at minimum, design with an ability to present tight pre-press
		    comps, 
			or, take the job to plate and onto press.</p>
		  <p>It should be noted that, although my desire would be always to have 
			creative control over design in the work I produce, there are numerous
		     instances when I have collaborated with designers and art directors
		    	simply for the fine presswork I am able to deliver. I started
		    my career 
			&quot;at the board&quot; in some of the largest <i>and</i> smallest 
			agencies in Boston. As a result, I can speak the language, but don't
			have to...</p>
		  <p>This is a small operation, and of necessity, my presses are the smallest
		     once available to produce professional grade printing. If you are interested
		     in larger format or longer run work, please feel free to browse the 
		  links section where you will find other brothers and sisters in the 
		  "black art" who might assist you in your quest for the best form of 
		  printing ever available.</p>
		  <p>be cool, be thoughtful, be here now, be sure to smile at babies</p>

		<blockquote> 
		  
        <p>It musta been back in the fall of '85, I picked up a copy of Camper
           Van Beethoven's LP &quot;Telephone Free Landslide Victory&quot;. It
            was printed on grey packing chipboard and was like no other record
           jacket  I had seen or acquired in my days as nascent record collector
           scum. (Well...  except maybe the first Buzzcock's LP in the PRODUCT
           bag.) Whatever the  process was I responded to it. There was witty
           copy on a sticker on  the back suggesting that it be purchased post
           haste lest one forever  regret the rare opportunity to own such a
           fine disc. Plus the band did  a cover of a Black Flag tune... I bought
           the disc and it remains in  a hallowed place in my collection. There
           were only 1000 copies pressed  by some guy in LA, name Bruce Licher
           at Independent Project Records 
          &amp; Press. </p>
        <p>That was my introduction to letterpress though I didn't know it. It
           was a couple more years before I brushed up against the process again
          
          after college. I was living in Boston working my first job out of art
           school (BFA '86) doing paste up for 15K per annum in &quot;the Boom
           Years&quot;.
            Yeah, good times... har. Uh, in any case, The Society of Printers'
           annual 
          Dwiggins Lecture was to feature a talk by the nearly peerless Barry
            Moser about the latest wood engravings he had cut for, and book he
           had 
          published at Pennyroyal Press, L. Frank Baum's "Wizard of Oz". At lunch
           prior that day I strayed to the now defunct Harvard Bookstore Cafe
          at 
          Newbury and Ex, having scraped together some book money. There, I purchased
           University of California Press trade editions of "Oz&quot; as well
           as Pennyroyal's "Alice's Adventure in Wonderland", also sublimely
           illustrated by Moser. I was, and still am, fascinated by wood engravings
           and the skills required,
            but 
          indeed equally by the layout and typography of primarily, the Alice.
             Elaborate Initial characters, expressive typography and marginal
            notes 
          in second and calligraphy in third colors were shiny objects to my
           magpie eye. I went to the lecture in Rabb Hall and was totally turned
           on by 
          Moser's work. The engravings for &quot;Oz&quot; were political satire,
           circa the Reagan Era. Ron was the Great and Powerful Oz, Nancy, yup
          
          the Wicked Witch. I stood in line back at HB Cafe, shook hands with,
           and expressed my admiration for, Mr. Moser's work. He signed both
          copies. 
          He had spoken at the Hartford Art School whilst I was matriculated
          thereto, but, the stars not being aligned at the time, I missed his
          lecture. 
          I did pick up one of the keepsakes printed by Harold McGrath that were
           left behind. A tenebristic engraving of a well worn tome below which
          
          lay a quote from uh,.. Erasmus... stating &quot;when I have a little
           money, I buy books, if there's anything left, food and drink&quot; or
            something to that effect. Seemed to make perfect sense (as my present
           
          library would attest)... So that, my second brush with letterpress,
            a more refined and crafted example than my first.</p>
		<p>I don't really remember the chain of events, in what must have been 1988,
		  that lead me to phone John Kristensen at Firefly Press. What snippets
		  I recall dealt with John telling me about the Guild and not usually hooking non-Guild
		  member up with equipment and such. I'm not sure if I had discovered the class
		  at the <a href="http://www.bcae.org/" target="_blank">Boston Center of Adult Edumacation</a>. Amber, my girlfriend at the time
		  planned a trip up to Wells, Maine to go book hunting since she knew I would
		  never have enough books. Fun enough time, stayed in Ogunquit, ate clams this and
		  lobster that when I still ate those sorts of things. Made my first really printing
		  oriented book buys at... er... i don't remember. ANYway, the seminal &quot;Printing
		  Types - ...&quot; by Updike and the &quot;The Manual of Linotype Typography&quot;.
		  That second title blew my mind. I don't think I had ever seen printing so
		  beautiful. No; I know I hadn't and believe me, there's much more sublime
		  work out there that I was wholly unaware of at the time. The UCP &quot;Alice&quot; was
		  cool but this had Depth of Impression. (A few
		  years later I was too intimidated by the <a href="http://www.bromer.com/" target="_blank">Bromers'</a> to turn the pages of a real
		  Pennyroyal Alice. At $4k I was afraid to even look at the box it was housed
	  in.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
